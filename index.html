<p>A minimal MEI customization that defines a basic subset of
  elements with appropriate restrictions for basic use cases. Note that
  this is still very much under developmen. A lot more elements are needed to be
  documented in order to properly reflect Tido's application profile.
</p>

<p>
  In its current form the documentation illustrates what kind of restrictions
  will be implemented for further elements. Elements that are currently not
  restricted are exluded from the schema for clarity.
</p>

<p>
  Even though this schema is intended to become the documentation of Tido's
  input format, we would also like to offer our work as a starting point
  for a basic MEI customization, that could be shared between several projects in the
  future. To this end, we would like to welcome comments and suggestions through
  <ref target="https://github.com/tido/mei-customization/issues">GitHub issues</ref>.

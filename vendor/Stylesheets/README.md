TEI XSL Stylesheets

This is a family of XSLT 2.0 stylesheets to transform TEI XML documents to various formats, including XHTML, LaTeX, XSL Formatting Objects, ePub, plain text, RDF, JSON; and to/from Word OOXML (docx) and OpenOfice (odt).  They concentrate on the core TEI modules which are used for simple transcription and "born digital" writing. It is important to understand that they do _not_:

a) cover all TEI elements and possible attribute values
b) attempt to define a standard TEI processing or rendering model

and should not be treated as the definitive view of the TEI Consortium.

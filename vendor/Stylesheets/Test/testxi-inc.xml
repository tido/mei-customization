	<head>Summary</head>
	<p>The Google Search Appliance which is used to provide a
	unified search across all public-facing university web sites
	comes up for renewal by February 2011. If we wish to consider
	a move to a software-only solution, we need at least 3 months
	to migrate, so a decision must be made in October 2010.</p>
	<p>The current solution does not permit for dual-site
	operation, and has a limit of 1 million documents, but the
	service is stable and seems to deliver an adequate
	service.</p>
	<p>A software-only solution would be preferable, and offer
	more flexible and extensible services, but the cost would very
	likely be higher in  the short-term.</p>
	<p>It is recommended that we negotiate a new 2 year agreement
	with Google and review again in 2012.</p>

  <head>Critical Apparatus</head>
  <p>This chapter describes how to encode differences between multiple exemplars of the same musical
    work (often referred to in MEI as <soCalled>sources</soCalled>). The mechanisms and elements
    described in this chapter are closely related to their counterparts in the TEI guidelines. It is
    also important to refer to chapter <ptr target="#editTrans"/> of these guidelines, especially
    concerning the <gi scheme="MEI">choice</gi> element described therein.</p>
  <div type="div2" xml:id="critAppElements">
    <head>General Usage</head>
    <p>The following elements are defined in the critApp Module:</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="app"/>
        <specDesc key="lem"/>
        <specDesc key="rdg"/>
      </specList>
    </p>
    <p>An <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> element always encapsulates the differences between varying
      sources. Therefore, it must contain at least two child elements.
      <!-- PR: Need schematron rule for this! --> Possible child elements are <gi scheme="MEI"
        >lem</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi>, which use the same model, but have a different
      meaning: Whereas <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> is used for prioritizing one alternative, a <gi
        scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> has no such additional meaning and simply indicates a reading as found
      in one or more sources. Accordingly, <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> is allowed only once in <gi
        scheme="MEI">app</gi>, whereas <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> may appear as often as
      necessary.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<app>
  <lem>
    <!-- preferred reading -->
  </lem>
  <rdg>
    <!-- alternative reading -->
  </rdg>
  <rdg>
    <!-- alternative reading -->
  </rdg>
</app>
    </egXML>

    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> (and <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi>) elements use the
        <att>source</att> attribute to point to one or more descriptions of the bibliographic
      sources containing the material they mark:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<!-- In the document content: -->
<app>
  <rdg source="#critApp.source1">
    <!-- reading of source 1 -->
  </rdg>
  <rdg source="#critApp.source2 #critApp.source3">
    <!-- reading of sources 2 *and* 3 -->
  </rdg>
</app>
<!-- Earlier in the document header: -->
<sourceDesc>
  <source xml:id="critApp.source1">
    <!-- bibliographic description of source 1 -->
  </source>
  <source xml:id="critApp.source2">
    <!-- bibliographic description of source 2 -->
  </source>
  <source xml:id="critApp.source3">
    <!-- bibliographic description of source 3 -->
  </source>
</sourceDesc>
    </egXML>

    <p>The <att>seq</att> attribute may be used on <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI"
        >rdg</gi> to record the sequence of a series of readings. In the following example, the
      material in source B is marked as sequential to (and perhaps derived from) the reading in
      source A:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<app>
  <rdg source="#critApp.sourceA" seq="1">
    <!-- material in source 1 -->
  </rdg>
  <rdg source="#critApp.sourceB" seq="2">
    <!-- material in source 2 -->
  </rdg>
</app>
    </egXML>

    <p>If a source has additional content that is not found in other sources, an empty <gi
        scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> element may be used to indicate the lack of material in the other
      sources. In the following example, source 1 includes material that is not found in sources 2
      and 3:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<app>
  <rdg source="#critApp.source1">
    <!-- additional content of source 1 -->
  </rdg>
  <rdg source="#critApp.source2 #critApp.source3"/>
</app>
    </egXML>

    <p>When working with a large number of sources, it might seem tedious to provide references for
      all sources. However, use of the <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> element without <att>source</att>
      is not recommended because such an encoding is not explicit and is therefore difficult to
      process.</p>
  </div>
  <div type="div2" xml:id="critappInContent">
    <head>Variants in Musical Content</head>
    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> element may be used to accommodate textual variation at nearly
      any point in a musical text. For example, it may be used to indicate minor differences such as
      stem directions:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<layer>
  <!-- preceding notes -->
  <app>
    <rdg source="#critApp.source1">
      <note pname="b" oct="4" dur="2" stem.dir="down"/>
    </rdg>
    <rdg source="#critApp.source2">
      <note pname="b" oct="4" dur="2" stem.dir="up"/>
    </rdg>
  </app>
  <!-- following notes -->
</layer>
    </egXML>

    <p>or to indicate more significant differences, such as the insertion of extra measures:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<section>
  <measure/>
  <measure/>
  <app>
    <rdg source="#critApp.source1"/>
    <rdg source="#critApp.source2">
      <!-- source 2 has 2 measures not found in source 1 -->
      <measure/>
      <measure/>
    </rdg>
  </app>
  <measure/>
</section>
    </egXML>

    <!-- Here we might add several other examples -->

    <p>However, the flexibility in the location of <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> places a burden on the
      encoder to ensure that the <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi>, and <gi
        scheme="MEI">lem</gi> elements are used correctly; that is, the content of every <gi
        scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> has to be a valid replacement for its
      parent <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi>.</p>

    <head>Variants in Score Definitions</head>
    <p>In addition to its use for differentiation of the musical content of multiple sources, <gi
        scheme="MEI">app</gi> may also be utilized to describe the layout of different scores, even
      when the musical content itself remains the same. An example of this is two sources that have
      the same content, but a different ordering of staves on which the content is written. By
      definition, the order of staves is derived from the order of <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi>
      elements in <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>, not from the order of <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi>
      elements within a <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>. The <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> element in a
      measure points to its corresponding <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> using either 1) the same
      value for <att>n</att> on both elements, or 2) a value in <att>def</att> which is an explicit
      reference to a particular <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> using its <att>xml:id</att>
      value.</p>

    <!-- PR: Even though it's technically possble, the following makes me uncomfortable. I think
      this is good reason to put some effort into the layout module. -->
    <p>When using the first of these two approaches, it is possible to point dynamically to the
      correct staff definition for a given source. The following example demonstrates how this can
      be accomplished for two sources, both presenting a two-staff score, but with differing staff
      order. No further <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> element is necessary within the <gi scheme="MEI"
        >measure</gi> to describe the alternative score order of the sources.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<score>
  <app>
    <rdg source="#critApp.source1">
      <scoreDef>
        <staffGrp>
          <staffDef n="1"/>
          <staffDef n="2"/>
        </staffGrp>
      </scoreDef>
    </rdg>
    <rdg source="#critApp.source2">
      <scoreDef>
        <staffGrp>
          <!-- The order of <staffDef> elements defines score order, not its @n attribute! -->
          <staffDef n="2"/>
          <staffDef n="1"/>
        </staffGrp>
      </scoreDef>
    </rdg>
  </app>
  <section>
    <measure>
      <staff n="1"/>
      <staff n="2"/>
    </measure>
  </section>
</score>
    </egXML>

    <p>when unique values for <att>n</att> on <gi scheme="MEI">layerDef</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI"
        >layer</gi> are provided, it is possible to reallocate layers in the same fashion as
      staves.</p>

    <!-- The following paragraph needs more explanation and an example. -->
    <p>This mechanism may also be used to describe not only differing page orientations, formats and
      margins, but also clefs and keys.</p>

    <p>In some situations, musical sources will agree at one level while differing at a lower level.
      For these cases, <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> elements may be nested to any level necessary. In
      the following example, there are three sources, two of which agree on the addition of a
      measure, but differ in the content of the added measure:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<measure/>
<app>
  <rdg source="#critApp.source1"/>
  <rdg source="#critApp.source2 critApp.#source3">
    <!-- whereas source1 omits it, source2 and source3 have an additional measure -->
    <measure>
      <staff>
        <layer>
          <app>
            <!-- while source2 provides a measure rest, source3 has a whole note -->
            <rdg source="#critApp.source2">
              <mRest/>
            </rdg>
            <rdg source="#critApp.source3">

      </staff>
    </measure>
  </rdg>
</app>
<measure/>
    </egXML>

    <p>When nesting <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> elements, it is important that the value(s) in the
      child <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> element's <att>source</att> attribute must be a strict subset
      of the ancestor <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> element's <att>source</att> value.</p>

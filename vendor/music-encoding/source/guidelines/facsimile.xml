  <head>Facsimiles</head>
  <p>Most often, MEI is used for the preparation of a digital musical text based on an existing
    music document, or with the intention of rendering the encoded notation into a document or audio
    rendition. MEI can, however, be used to provide a different kind of digital reproduction of a
    source document, which relies on the description and provision of digital imagery. Both
    approaches may be combined, so that the encoding of the musical content and digital facsimiles
    may add different facets to the same MEI document.</p>
  <div type="div2" xml:id="facsimileElements">
    <head>Elements of the Facsimile Module</head>
    <p>This module makes available the following elements for encoding facsimiles:</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="facsimile"/>
        <specDesc key="surface"/>
        <specDesc key="zone"/>
      </specList>
    </p>
    <p>These element are used to add a separate subtree to MEI, starting with the <gi scheme="MEI"
        >facsimile</gi> element inside <gi scheme="MEI">music</gi>, as seen in the following
      example:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<mei>
  <meiHead>
    <!-- metadata header -->
  </meiHead>
  <music>
    <facsimile>
      <!-- The facsimile subtree starts here. -->
    </facsimile>
    <body>
      <!-- The encoding of the musical content goes here. -->
    </body>
  </music>
</mei>
    </egXML>

    <p>It is possible to have more than one <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> element in this
      location. This is especially useful when multiple sources are encoded in the same file using
      the mechanisms described in chapter <ptr target="#editTrans"/> of these Guidelines. In this
      case, the <att>decls</att> (declarations) attribute of <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> may be
      used to refer to a source defined in the document's header, as seen in the following
      example:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<meiHead>
  <source xml:id="facsimile.source1">
    <!-- description of source -->
  </source>
</meiHead>
<music>
  <facsimile decls="#facsimile.source1">
    <!-- facsimile content -->
  </facsimile>
</music>
    </egXML>

    <p>Within a <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> element, each page of the source is represented by a
        <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi> element. Each surface may be assigned an identifying string
      utilizing the <att>label</att> attribute. In addition, it may encapsulate more detailed
      metadata about itself in a <gi scheme="MEI">figDesc</gi> element. The coordinate space of the
      surface may be recorded in abstract terms in the <att>ulx</att>, <att>uly</att>,
        <att>lrx</att>, and <att>lry</att> attributes. For navigation purposes, <gi scheme="MEI"
        >surface</gi> has a <att>startid</att> attribute that accommodates pointing to the first
      object appearing on this particular writing surface.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<facsimile>
  <surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="2000" lry="3000" label="page 1" startid="#measure1"/>
</facsimile>
    </egXML>

    <p>Within <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi> elements, one may nest one or more <gi scheme="MEI"
        >graphic</gi> elements, each providing a reference to an image file that represents the
      writing surface. Multiple <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> elements are permitted in order to
      accommodate alternative versions (different resolutions or formats, for instance) of the
      surface image. In spite of changes in resolution or format, all images must contain the same
      content, i.e., the entire writing surface.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<facsimile>
  <surface>
    <graphic target="image1.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" unit="px"/>
    <graphic target="image1smaller.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" unit="px"/>
    <graphic target="image1smallest.png" width="300" height="200" unit="px"/>
  </surface>
</facsimile>
    </egXML>

    <p>The preceding markup will provide the basis for most page-turning applications. Often,
      however, it is desirable to focus attention on particular areas of the graphical
      representation of the surface. The <gi scheme="MEI">zone</gi> element fulfills this
      purpose:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="3000" lry="2000">
  <graphic target="image1.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" unit="px"/>
  <zone ulx="300" uly="200" lrx="370" lry="410"/>
  <zone ulx="367" uly="200" lrx="439" lry="410"/>
  <zone ulx="436" uly="200" lrx="512" lry="410"/>
</surface>
    </egXML>

    <!--<p>The preceding example also illustrates how <gi scheme="MEI">zone</gi> can be used directly within
        <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi> to draw attention to areas within a writing surface for which there is no
      corresponding graphic image file.</p>-->

    <!--<p>In the following example, the surface is defined as rectange that is 3000 units wide and 2000
      units tall. The graphic that represents the surface, however, is only 2995 units wide and 1995
      units tall; that is, the graphic has been <soCalled>cropped</soCalled> with respect to the
      writing surface.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
      <surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="3000" lry="2000">
        <graphic target="image1.jpg" width="2995" height="1995" unit="px"/>
      </surface>
    </egXML>-->

    <p>The coordinates of each zone <emph>define a space relative to the coordinate space of its
        parent surface</emph>. Note that this is not necessarily the same coordinate space defined
      by the width and height attributes of the graphic that represents the surface. The zone
      coordinates in the preceding example do not represent regions within the graphic, but rather
      regions of the <emph>writing surface</emph>.</p>

    <p>Because the coordinate space of a zone is defined relative to that of a surface, it is
      possible to provide multiple graphic elements <emph>and</emph> multiple zone elements within a
      single surface. In the following example, two different images representing the entire surface
      are provided alongside specification of two zones of interest within the surface:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="3000" lry="2000">
  <graphic target="image1.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" unit="px"/>
  <graphic target="image1cropped.jpg" width="2995" height="1995" unit="px"/>
  <zone ulx="300" uly="200" lrx="370" lry="410"/>
  <zone ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="30" lry="30"/>
</surface>
    </egXML>

    <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">zone</gi> element may contain <gi scheme="MEI">figDesc</gi> or <gi
        scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> elements that provide detailed descriptive information about the
      zone and additional images, e.g., at a different/higher resolution, of the rectangle defined
      by the zone. The data objects contained within the zone may also be specified through the use
      of the <att>data</att> attribute, which contains ID references to one more elements in the
      content tree of the MEI file, such as a <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI"
        >measure</gi>, etc.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<!-- In the facsimile subtree: -->
<zone xml:id="facsimile.zone1" data="#facsimile.measure1"/>
<!-- somewhere in the content: -->
<measure xml:id="facsimile.measure1">
  <!-- measure content -->
</measure>
    </egXML>

    <p>Conversely, an element in the content may refer to the <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi>
      subtree using its <att>facs</att> attribute, which is made available by the <ident
        type="class">att.facsimile</ident> attribute class. The last example could therefore be
      encoded with pointers in the other direction:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<!-- In the facsimile subtree: -->
<zone xml:id="facsimile.zone2"/>
<!-- somewhere in the content: -->
<measure xml:id="facsimile.measure2" facs="#facsimile.zone2">
  <!-- measure content -->
</measure>
    </egXML>

    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">pb</gi> element defined in the <ref target="#shared">shared module</ref>
      makes special use of the <att>facs</att> attribute, in that it does not point to a <gi
        scheme="MEI">zone</gi>, but a <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi> element instead. A <gi
        scheme="MEI">pb</gi> marks the beginning of a page, so it can be concluded that all elements
      in the content tree which are encoded between any two <gi scheme="MEI">pb</gi> elements encode
      musical symbols written on the page (<gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi>) referenced by the first of
      these two <gi scheme="MEI">pb</gi> element's <att>facs</att> attribute.</p>

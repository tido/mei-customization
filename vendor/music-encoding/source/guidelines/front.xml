    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p>This release of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) provides three major components:</p>
    <list>
      <item>formalized rules for recording the intellectual and physical characteristics of music
        notation documents so that the information contained in them may be searched, retrieved,
        displayed, and exchanged in a predictable and platform-independent manner;</item>
      <item>a <q>Tag Library</q> that documents the components of the MEI model; and</item>
      <item>best practices guidelines for the application of those rules.</item>
    </list>
    <p>Both the MEI rules and their documentation are expressed in the form of a One Document
      Does-it-all (ODD) document, a format developed by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). The MEI
      ODD document has been processed to create the MEI application guidelines, Tag Library, and
      accompanying schemas.</p>
    <p>The MEI Guidelines, which include the Tag Library, are intended to serve as a reference tool
      for music encoders. Through the use of natural-language definitions and examples, this
      document assists users of MEI in achieving effective and consistent markup. Despite
      translating XML and RNG terminology and concepts into more accessible language, it is still a
      technical one that presupposes a minimal understanding of XML and music notation. Novice
      encoders will need to supplement their use of the Guidelines by participating in discussions
      on the MEI-L list, attending introductory MEI workshops and training classes and by referring
      to other information sources.</p>
    <p>As a natural-language translation of the MEI conceptual model, the Guidelines convey
      information about the three principal tasks accomplished by the model. First, the model breaks
      down the content of music notation documents into data fields or categories of information
      called "elements". All of these elements are named, defined, and described in the tag library.
      Second, the tag library identifies and defines attributes associated with those elements.
      Attributes are characteristics or properties that further refine the element. Last, and
      perhaps most importantly, the tag library documents the structure of the MEI model by
      explaining the relationship between elements, specifying where the elements may be used and
      describing how they may be modified by attributes. While two of the basic purposes of MEI
      encompass the searching and display of encoded music notation documents in an electronic
      environment, nothing in the tag library specifically addresses their implementation. Searching
      and display are entirely dependent on software applications outside the scope of the MEI
      model.</p>
    <p>The MEI model contains only a few required elements, the majority are optional. Therefore,
      the amount of markup desired will vary from one situation to another depending on
      intellectual, technical, and temporal considerations. Creating encoded music notation
      documents for inclusion in union databases may also result in tagging requirements that are
      separate from those dictated by the model.</p>
    <p>Suggestions for new elements, revised descriptions, and more illustrative examples may be
      submitted to the MEI Working Group via the MEI discussion list at <ref
        target="mei-l@lists.uni-paderborn.de">mei-l@lists.uni-paderborn.de</ref>. The model and
      Guidelines will be updated periodically based on the feedback received from the users of
      MEI.</p>

  <div>
    <head>MEI Design Principles</head>
    <p>This section of the Guidelines defines principles and criteria for designing, developing, and
      maintaining an XML-based encoding scheme for music notation documents.</p>
    <list>
      <head>Definitions and Parameters</head>
      <item>A music notation document is one that contains music notation; that is, any one of a
        number of "visual analogues of musical sound, either as a record of sound heard or imagined,
        or as a set of visual instructions for performers." (Ian D. Bent, et al. "Notation." Grove
        Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 25 May 2010. &lt;<ref
          target="http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20114"
          >http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20114</ref>&gt;.)</item>
      <item>The encoding scheme permits both the creation of new music notation documents and the
        conversion of existing ones from print and other electronic formats. However, conversion of
        existing documents may require revisions in content or rearrangement of information.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>General Principles</head>
      <item>No prima facia distinction is made between a primary source of music notation, such as
        an autograph or published score, and a secondary source, such as a scholarly edition based
        on one or more primary sources. The tag set encompasses both, and the encoder must choose
        the elements and attributes most appropriate in each case.</item>
      <item>As an encoded representation of one or more music notation documents, an MEI file may be
        employed as a surrogate for the original materials.</item>
      <item>Although the encoding scheme does not define or prescribe intellectual content for music
        notation documents, it does define content designation and is intended to be used with
        available data content standards. MEI identifies the essential data elements within music
        notation documents and establishes codes and conventions necessary for capturing and
        distinguishing information within those elements for future action or manipulation. While
        there are a few elements that ought to appear in any MEI document, various intellectual,
        technical, and economic factors influence the level of detail of analysis and encoding
        actually undertaken. Taking this into consideration, the encoding scheme is designed with a
        minimum of required elements and allows for progressively more detailed levels of
        description as desired.</item>
      <item>The encoding scheme preserves and enhances the current functionality of existing music
        notation documents. It permits identification of document structures and content that
        support description, navigation, analysis, and online and print presentation.</item>
      <item>The encoding scheme is intended to facilitate interchange between notational tools. It
        aims to assist in the creation of more effective and consistent encoding, encourage the
        creation of cooperatively-created and widely available databases of music notation
        documents, and permit the reuse of encoded data for multiple output purposes. It will also
        ensure that machine-readable music notation documents will outlive changing hardware and
        software environments because they are based on a platform-independent standard.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>Structural Features</head>
      <item>The encoding scheme is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), a text-based format
        for representing structured information. It is expressed as a One Document Does-it-all (ODD)
        document, referred to as the "Music Encoding (MEI) Guidelines". For more information on ODD,
        please refer to TEI Guidelines chapter 22 (<ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html"
          >http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html</ref>), chapter 23 (<ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html"
          >http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html</ref>), and to the TEI's
        "Getting Started with P5 ODDs" document (<ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml"
          >http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml</ref>).</item>
      <item>Related or complementary standards, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
        Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (<ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/">http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/</ref>),
        the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) (<ref target="http://www.loc.gov/ead/"
          >http://www.loc.gov/ead/</ref>), MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data (<ref
          target="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdhome.html"
          >http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdhome.html</ref>), existing notation encoding
        schemes, etc. have been consulted and employed as appropriate. For example, the data model
        includes a header that is comparable to the TEI header, and TEI and EAD naming conventions
        and tag structures have been used whenever feasible. However, while some feature names are
        similar, or even the same, it is important to recognize that MEI and TEI have different
        semantic scope. Obviously, a note element in MEI does not carry the same meaning as the
        element of the same name in TEI. Perhaps less obviously, a phrase in music notation is
        unrelated to a textual phrase.</item>
      <item>With respect to metadata, MEI recognizes the close relationship between the metadata
        content found in the MEI header and that of catalog records, authority records, and finding
        aids, and it provides for the use of an encoding equivalency attribute for MEI elements
        corresponding to fields in other metadata standards.</item>
      <item>To ensure broad international and multi-repertoire application of MEI, existing musical
        terminology was used in building the data model where practical. In addition, a method for
        localization of the data model's names has been provided. Finally, extensive use of
        attributes in the schema permits the refinement of element meanings with specific musical,
        geographic, or temporal contexts.</item>
    </list>
    <list>
      <head>Control and Maintenance</head>
      <item>Control and maintenance of the MEI model, schemas and documentation will be provided by
        a maintenance agency working in concert with the national and international music
        communities, assisted in an advisory capacity by other interested groups of users.</item>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="div1" xml:id="figTable" n="0">
  <head>Figures and Tables</head>
  <p>Apart from music and text, musical documents, both historical and contemporary, may also
    contain material in graphical or tabular format. In such materials, details of layout and
    presentation may also be of comparatively greater significance or complexity than they are for
    running text. Although some types of graphical material can be represented directly with markup,
    it is more common practice to include such information by using a reference to an external
    entity (typically a URL) encoded in a suitable graphical format.</p>
  <p>The module defined by this chapter defines special purpose <soCalled>container</soCalled>
    elements that can be used to encapsulate occurrences of such data within an MEI-conformant
    document in a portable way. Specific recommendations for the encoding of figures, figure
    descriptions and graphics as well as tables with their sub-elements <gi scheme="MEI">tr</gi>,
      <gi scheme="MEI">td</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">th</gi> are provided at the beginnig of this
    chapter. As there exists a wide variety of different graphic formats, a short list of formats
    that are widely used at the present time, is given in section <ptr target="#figtableImages"/>.
    Each one includes a very brief description. The chapter closes with attribute and model classes
    which are defined by the module.</p>
  <p>The module described in this chapter makes available the following components:</p>

  <div type="div2" xml:id="figures">
    <head>Figures</head>
    <p> The <gi scheme="MEI">fig</gi> element groups elements representing or containing graphic
      information such as an illustration or figure. This element is modelled on the figure element
      in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). The <gi scheme="MEI">fig</gi> element is used to
      contain images, captions, and textual descriptions of the pictures. The images themselves are
      specified using the <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> element, whose <att>target</att> attribute
      provides the location of an image. For example:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<fig>
  <graphic target="../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-300.png"/>
</fig>
    </egXML>
    <p>The graphic element may occur multiple times within the markup of the figure in order to
      indicate the availablity of different image formats or resolutions:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<fig>
  <graphic target="../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-72.png"/>
  <graphic target="../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-300.png"/>
  <graphic target="../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-600.png"/>
</fig>
    </egXML>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="figureCaptionsDescriptions">
      <head>Figure Captions and Descriptions</head>
      <p>The element <gi scheme="MEI">caption</gi> may be used to transcribe (or supply) a title or
        descriptive heading for the graphic itself, as in the following example:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<fig>
  <caption>Grace notes</caption>
  <graphic target="../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-300.png"/>
</fig>
      </egXML>
      <p>The figure description (<gi scheme="MEI">figDesc</gi>) element usually contains a brief
        prose description of the appearance or content of a graphic figure, for use when documenting
        an image, perhaps without displaying it. This element is intended for use as an alternative
        to the content of its parent <gi scheme="MEI">figure</gi> element; for example, for display
        when the equipment in use cannot display graphic images. It may also be used for indexing or
        documentary purposes, in which case best practice suggests the use of controlled vocabulary
        terms.</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<fig>
  <graphic target="emblem1.png"/>
  <caption>Emblemi d'Amore</caption>
  <figDesc>A pair of naked winged cupids, each holding a flaming torch, in a rural
    setting.</figDesc>
</fig>
      </egXML>
      <p>Occasionally, a figure description may have a complex structure. In this case, one or more
        textual component elements (<gi scheme="MEI">paragraph</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">table</gi>,
          <gi scheme="MEI">list</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">quote</gi>, or <gi scheme="MEI">lg</gi>) may
        be used to model the internal structure of the description:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<fig>
  <caption>Grace notes</caption>
  <figDesc>
    <p>The example shows grace notes within beams ...</p>

    </div>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="figtableImages">
      <head>Images</head>
      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> element indicates the location of an inline graphic,
        illustration, or figure. As noted above, there exists a wide variety of different graphics
        formats, and the following list is in no way exhaustive. Moreover, inclusion of any format
        in this list should not be taken as indicating endorsement by the MEI of this format or any
        products associated with it. Some of the formats listed here are proprietary to a greater or
        lesser extent and cannot therefore be regarded as standards in any meaningful sense. They
        are, however, widely used by many different vendors. The following formats are widely used
        at the present time, and are likely to remain supported by more than one vendor's
        software:</p>

        <list type="gloss">
          <label>CGM: Computer Graphics Metafile</label>
          <item> - This vector graphics format is specified by an ISO standard, ISO 8632:1987,
            amended in 1990. It defines binary, character, and plain-text encodings; the non-binary
            forms are safer for blind interchange, especially over networks. Documentation is
            available from ISO and from its member national bodies, such as AFNOR, ANSI, BSI, DIN,
            JIS, etc.</item>
          <label>SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics format</label>
          <item> - SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector or
            raster graphics in XML. It is defined by the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.0
            Specification, W3C Recommendation, 04 September 2001, available at <ref
              target="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/"

          <label>PICT: Macintosh drawing format</label>
          <item> - This format is universally supported on Macintosh (tm) systems, and readable by a
            limited range of software for other systems. Documentation is available from Apple
            Computer, Cupertino, California USA.</item>

          <label>PNG: Portable Network Graphics format</label>
          <item> - PNG is a non-proprietary raster format currently widely available. It provides an
            extensible file format for the losslessly compressed storage of raster images.
            Indexed-color, grayscale, and true-color images are supported, plus an optional alpha
            channel. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits. It is defined by IETF RFC 2083, March
            1997.</item>
          <label>TIFF: Tagged Image File Format</label>
          <item> - Currently the most widely supported raster image format, especially for black and
            white images, TIFF is also one of the few formats commonly supported on more than one
            operating system. The drawback to TIFF is that it actually is a wrapper for several
            formats, and some TIFF-supporting software does not support all variants. TIFF files may
            use LZW, CCITT Group 4, or PackBits compression methods, or may use no compression at
            all. Also, TIFF files may be monochrome, greyscale, or polychromatic. All such options
            should be specified in prose at the end of the <gi scheme="MEI">encodingDesc</gi>
            section of the MEI header for any document including TIFF images. TIFF is owned by Aldus
            Corporation. Documentation on TIFF is available from the owner at Craigcook Castle,
            Craigcook Road, Edinburgh EH4 3UH, Scotland, or 411 First Avenue South, Seattle,
            Washington 98104 USA.</item>
          <label>GIF: Graphics Interchange Format</label>
          <item> - Raster images are widely available in this form, which was created by CompuServe
            Information Services, but has by now been implemented for many other systems as well.
            Documentation is copyright by, and is available from, CompuServe Incorporated, Graphics
            Technology Department, 5000 Arlington Center Boulevard, Columbus, Ohio 43220 USA. </item>
          <label>PBM: Portable Bit Map</label>
          <item> - PBM files are easy to process, eschewing all compression in favor of transparency
            of file format. PBM files can, of course, be compressed by generic file-compression
            tools for storage and transfer. Public domain software exists which will convert many
            other formats to and from PBM. Documentation of PBM is copyright by Jeff Poskanzer, and
            is available widely on the Internet.</item>
          <label>PCX: IBM PC raster format</label>
          <item> - This format is used by most IBM PC paint programs, and supports both monochrome
            and polychromatic images. Documentation is available from ZSoft Corporation, Technical
            Support Department, ATTN: Technical Reference Manual, 450 Franklin Rd. Suite 100,
            Marietta, GA 30067 USA.</item>
          <label>BMP: Microsoft bitmap format</label>
          <item> - This format is the standard raster format for computer using Microsoft Windows

            Standard 10918-1, and CCITT T.81. It handles monochrome and polychromatic images with a
            variety of compression techniques. JPEG per se, like CCITT Group IV, must be

          <!--<label>SMIL: Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language format</label>
            <item>SMIL is a W3C Recommendation which supports the integration of independent
              multimedia objects into a synchronized multimedia presentation. It provides multimedia
              authors with easily-defined basic timing relationships, fine-tuned synchronization,
              spatial layout, direct inclusion of non-text and non-image media objects, hyperlink
              support for time-based media, adaptiveness to varying user and system characteristics.
              SMIL 1.0 (<ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/"/>) became a W3C Recommendation
              on June 15, 1998, and was further developed in SMIL 2.0. SMIL 2.0 adds native support
              for transitions, animation, event-based interaction, extended layout facilities, and
              more sophisticated timing and synchronization primitives to the SMIL 1.0 language. It
              also allows reuse of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based languages, in
              particular those who need to represent timing and synchronization. For example, SMIL
              2.0 components are used for integrating timing into XHTML Document Types and into SVG.
              SMIL 2.0 also provides recommendations for Document Types based on SMIL 2.0 Modules
                (<ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-modules.html"/>). One such Document
              Type is the SMIL 2.0 Language Profile (<ref
                target="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil20-profile.html"/>). It contains support for
              all of the major SMIL 2.0 features including animation, content control, layout,
              linking, media object, meta-information, structure, timing, and transition effects and
              is designed for Web clients that support direct playback from SMIL 2.0 markup. SMIL
              2.0 (<ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/"/>) became a W3C Recommendation on
              August 7, 2001, becoming the first vocabulary to provide XML Schema support and to
              have reached such status.</item>-->

  <div type="div2" xml:id="tables">
    <head>Tables</head>
    <p>The element <gi scheme="MEI">table</gi> contains text displayed in tabular form, i.e., in
      rows and columns. A table is the least <soCalled>graphic</soCalled> of the elements discussed
      in this chapter. Almost any text structure can be presented as a series of rows and columns:
      one might, for example, choose to show a glossary or other form of list in tabular form,
      without necessarily regarding it as a table. When tabular presentation is regarded as of less
      intrinsic importance, it is correspondingly simpler to encode descriptive or functional
      information about the contents of the table, for example to identify one cell as containing a
      name and another as containig a date, though the two methods may be combined. </p>
    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">table</gi> element may appear both within other components (such as
      paragraphs), or between them, provided that the module defined in this chapter has been
      enabled. It is to a large extent arbitrary whether a table should be regarded as a series of
      rows or as a series of columns. For compatibility with currently available systems, however,
      these Guidelines require a row-by-row description of a table.</p>
    <p>While rows and columns are always encoded in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, formatting
      properties such as those provided by CSS may be used to specify that they should be displayed
      differently.</p>

    <div type="div3" xml:id="tableRows">

      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">tr</gi> (table row) element is a formatting element that contains one

          scheme="MEI">table</gi>. A cell is the intersection of a row and a column. The precise
        rendition of the table and its cells should be specified in a style steet.</p>

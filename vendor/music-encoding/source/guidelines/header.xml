  <head>The MEI Header</head>
  <p>This chapter addresses the description of an encoded item so that the musical text, as well as
    its sources, encoding, and revisions are all thoroughly documented. Such documentation is
    necessary for scholars using the texts, for software processing them, and for catalogers in
    libraries and archives. Together these descriptions and declarations provide an electronic
    analog to the title page attached to a printed work. They also constitute an equivalent for the
    content of the code books or introductory manuals customarily accompanying electronic data
    sets.</p>
  <p>Every MEI-conformant text not embedded in another XML carrier that provides for capturing
    metadata, such as TEI or METS, must carry a set of descriptions, prefixed to it and encoded as
    described in this chapter. This set is known as the MEI header, tagged <gi scheme="MEI"
      >meiHead</gi>, and has five major parts:</p>
  <list type="ordered">
    <item>one or more alternative identifiers, tagged with <gi scheme="MEI">altId</gi>, each of
      which provides an identifying name or number associated with the file.</item>
    <item>a <term>file description</term>, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi>, containing a full
      bibliographic description of the computer file itself, from which a user of the text could
      derive a proper bibliographic citation, or which a librarian or archivist could use in
      creating a catalog entry recording its presence within a library or archive. The term
        <term>computer file</term> here is to be understood as referring to the whole intellectual
      entity or document described by the header, even when this is stored in multiple physical
      operating system files. The file description also includes information about the source or
      sources from which the electronic document was derived. The MEI elements used to encode the
      file description are described in section <ptr target="#fileDescription"/> below.</item>
    <item>an <term>encoding description</term>, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">encodingDesc</gi>, which
      describes the relationship between an electronic text and its source or sources. It allows for
      detailed description of whether (or how) the text was normalized during transcription, how the
      encoder resolved ambiguities in the source, what levels of encoding or analysis were applied,
      and similar matters. The MEI elements used to encode the encoding description are described in
      section <ptr target="#encodingDescription"/> below.</item>
    <item>a <term>work description</term>, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">workDesc</gi>, containing
      classification and contextual information about the work, such as its subject matter, the
      situation in which it was produced, the individuals described by or participating in producing
      it, and so forth. Such a work profile is of particular use in highly structured composite
      texts such as corpora or language collections, where it is often highly desirable to enforce a
      controlled descriptive vocabulary or to perform retrievals from a body of text in terms of
      text type or origin. The work description may however be of use in any form of automatic text
      processing. The MEI elements used to encode the <term>work description</term> are described in
      section <ptr target="#workDescription"/> below.</item>
    <item>a <term>revision history</term>, tagged <gi scheme="MEI">revisionDesc</gi>, which allows
      the encoder to provide a history of changes made during the development of the electronic
      text. The revision history is important for <term>version control</term> and for resolving
      questions about the history of a file. The MEI elements used to encode the revision
      description are described in section <ptr target="#revisionDescription"/> below.</item>
  </list>
  <div type="div2" xml:id="fileDescription">
    <head>File Description</head>
    <p>The structure of the bibliographic description of a machine-readable or digital musical text
      resembles that of a book, an article, or other kinds of textual objects. The file description
      element of the MEI header has therefore been closely modelled on existing standards in library
      cataloging; it should thus provide enough information to allow users to give standard
      bibliographic references to the electronic text, and to allow catalogers to catalog it.
      Bibliographic citations occurring elsewhere in the header, and in the text itself, are derived
      from the same model.</p>
    <p>The bibliographic description of an electronic musical text should be supplied by the
      mandatory <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element:</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="fileDesc"/>
      </specList>
    </p>
    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element contains two mandatory and six optional elements,
      each of which is described in more detail below. These elements are listed below in the order
      in which they must occur within the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element.</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="titleStmt"/>
        <specDesc key="editionStmt"/>
        <specDesc key="extent"/>
        <specDesc key="pubStmt"/>
        <specDesc key="seriesStmt"/>
        <specDesc key="notesStmt"/>
        <specDesc key="sourceDesc"/>
      </specList>
    </p>
    <p>A complete file description will resemble the following example:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">

  <titleStmt>
    <title><!-- title of the resource --></title>

  </sourceDesc>
</fileDesc>
</egXML>
    <div xml:id="titlestmt" type="div3">
      <head>Title Statement</head>
      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> element is the first component of the <gi scheme="MEI"
          >fileDesc</gi> element, and is mandatory:</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="titleStmt"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>The title statement contains the title given to the electronic work, together with one or
        more optional statements of responsibility which identify the encoder, editor, author,
        compiler, or other parties responsible for it:</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="title"/>
          <specDesc key="arranger"/>
          <specDesc key="author"/>
          <specDesc key="composer"/>
          <specDesc key="editor"/>
          <specDesc key="funder"/>
          <specDesc key="librettist"/>
          <specDesc key="lyricist"/>
          <specDesc key="sponsor"/>
          <specDesc key="respStmt"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> element contains the chief name of the electronic work. Its
        content takes the form considered appropriate by its creator. The element may be repeated,
        if the work has more than one title (perhaps in different languages). Where the electronic
        work is derived from an existing source text, it is strongly recommended that the title for
        the former should be derived from the latter, but clearly distinguishable from it, for
        example by the addition of a phrase such as ‘: an electronic transcription’ or ‘a digital
        edition’. This will distinguish the electronic work from the source text in citations and in
        catalogs, which contain descriptions of both types of material.</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<titleStmt xmlns="http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei">
  <title>Lieder-Album für die Jugend </title>
  <title type="subtitle">für Singstimme(n) und Klavier, <identifier>op.
    79</identifier></title>
  <title type="subtitle">an electronic transcription</title>
</titleStmt>
</egXML>
      <p>Other alternative titles or subtitles may be encoded in additional title elements with
        values in the <att>type</att> attribute that distinguish them from the chief title. Sample
        values for the <att>type</att> attribute include: main (main title), subordinate (subtitle,
        title of part), abbreviated (abbreviated form of title), alternative (alternate title by
        which the work is also known), translated (translated form of title), uniform (collective
        title).</p>
      <p>The <att>type</att> attribute is provided for convenience in analyzing titles and
        processing them according to their type; where such specialized processing is not necessary,
        there is no need for such analysis, and the entire title, including subtitles and any
        parallel titles, may be enclosed within a single <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> element, as in
        the following example:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<title>Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription</title>
</egXML>
      <p>The electronic work will also have an external name (its ‘filename’ or ‘data set name’) or
        reference number on the computer system where it resides at any time. This name is likely to
        change frequently, as new copies of the file are made on the computer system. Its form is
        entirely dependent on the particular computer system in use and thus cannot always easily be
        transferred from one system to another. Moreover, a given work may be composed of many
        files. For these reasons, these Guidelines strongly recommend that such names should not be
        used as the title for any electronic work.</p>
      <p>Helpful guidance on the formulation of useful descriptive titles in difficult cases may be
        found in the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (Gorman and Winkler, 1978, chapter 25) or in
        equivalent national-level bibliographical documentation.</p>
      <p>At a minimum, the creator of the musical text and the creator of the file should be
        identified. If the bibliographic description is for a corpus, identify the creator of the
        corpus. Optionally also include the names of others involved in the transcription or
        elaboration of the text, sponsors, and funding agencies. The name of the person responsible
        for physical data input need not normally be recorded, unless that person is also
        intellectually responsible for some aspect of the creation of the file.</p>
      <p>In traditional bibliographic practice, those with primary creative responsibility are given
        special prominence. MEI accommodates this approach by providing responsibility-role
        elements. For example:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<titleStmt>
  <title>Auf dem Hügel sitz ich spähend : an electronic transcription</title>
  <composer>Ludwig van Beethoven</composer>
  <lyricist>Aloys Jeitteles</lyricist>
</titleStmt>
</egXML>
      <p>Secondary intellectual responsibility in this case is encoded using <gi scheme="MEI"
          >respStmt</gi>. The <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi> element has two subcomponents: a <gi
          scheme="MEI">name</gi> element identifying a responsible individual or organization, and a
          <gi scheme="MEI">resp</gi> element indicating the nature of the responsibility. All names
        should be stated in the form in which the persons or bodies wish to be publicly cited. This
        will usually be the fullest form of the name, including first names. No specific
        recommendations are made at this time as to appropriate content for <gi scheme="MEI"
          >resp</gi>. However, it should make clear the nature of the responsibility.</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<titleStmt>
  <title>Auf dem Hügel sitz ich spähend : an electronic transcription</title>
  <composer>Ludwig van Beethoven</composer>
  <lyricist>Aloys Jeitteles</lyricist>
  <respStmt>
    <resp>Encoded by</resp>
    <name>Maja Hartwig</name>
    <name>Kristina Richts</name>
  </respStmt>
</titleStmt>
</egXML>
      <p>This method of encoding facilitates exchange of bibliographic data with library catalogs
        and bibliographic databases as well as applications whose handling of bibliographic data is
        restricted to traditional responsibility roles. Additional information regarding these
        responsibility-role elements can be found in chapter <ptr target="#bibliographicCitations"
        />.</p>
      <p>When the MEI.namesdates module is enabled, two additional elements are also permitted
        within <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi>:</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="corpName"/>
          <specDesc key="persName"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>These elements allow for more precise identification of the entity associated with the name
        than is permitted by the simpler <gi scheme="MEI">name</gi> element. The following example
        shows how a precise date range can be associated with a personal or corporate name.</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<respStmt>
  <resp>Machine-readable transcription by: </resp>
  <persName startdate="1860-01-01" enddate="1940-11-06">John Doe</persName>
</respStmt>
</egXML>
      <p>For additional information about corporate and personal names, see chapter <ptr
          target="#namesDates"/>.</p>
      <p>In addition to, or instead of the <gi scheme="MEI">resp</gi> element, the <att>role</att>
        attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">name</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">persName</gi>, and <gi
          scheme="MEI">corpName</gi> may be used to capture the nature of responsibility. While <gi
          scheme="MEI">resp</gi> accommodates capturing the wide variety of text that may occur in
        responsibility statements, use of the <att>role</att> attribute provides the possibility of
        recording a controlled value independently of the textual content of <gi scheme="MEI"
          >resp</gi>.</p>

          >http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html</ref>) or term list (<ref
          target="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html"
          >http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html</ref>) are recommended for
        <att>role</att>, where applicable.</p>
      <p>Where it is necessary to group responsibilities and names, multiple responsibility
        statements may be used. For example:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<titleStmt>
  <title>Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription</title>

  </respStmt>
  <respStmt>
    <resp>Images scanned by</resp>
    <persName>Ludwig van Ludwig</persName>
  </respStmt>
</titleStmt>
</egXML>
      <p>It is often desirable to mix primary and secondary intellectual responsibility information.
        Treating all intellectual roles the same way can allow literal transcription of existing
        responsibility statements and simplify programmatic processing. The following example
        demonstrates how a responsibility statement may be transcribed using interleaved <gi
          scheme="MEI">resp</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">persName</gi> elements:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<titleStmt>

    <persName role="encoder">Johannes Jones:</persName>
    <resp>Machine-readable transcription</resp>
  </respStmt>
</titleStmt>
</egXML>
      <p>However, eliminating explanatory text and relying on standardized values for
          <att>role</att>, as in the following example, allows data creation and processing tools of
        the greatest simplicity.</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">

    <div xml:id="editionstmt" type="div3">
      <head>Edition Statement</head>
      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">editionStmt</gi> element is the second component of the <gi
          scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element. It is optional but recommended when applicable.</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="editionStmt"/>
        </specList>
      </p>

      <p>
        <specList>

          <specDesc key="respStmt"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>For printed texts, the term <soCalled>edition</soCalled> applies to the set of all the
        identical copies of an item produced from one master copy and issued by a particular
        publishing agency or a group of such agencies. A change in the identity of the distributing
        body or bodies does not normally constitute a change of edition, while a change in the
        master copy does.</p>
      <p>For electronic texts, the notion of a <mentioned>master copy</mentioned> is not entirely
        appropriate, since they are far more easily copied and modified than printed ones;
        nonetheless, the term edition may be used for a particular state of a machine-readable text
        at which substantive changes are made and fixed. Synonymous terms used in these Guidelines
        are <mentioned>version</mentioned>, <mentioned>level</mentioned>, and
          <mentioned>release</mentioned>. The words <mentioned>revision</mentioned> and
          <mentioned>update</mentioned>, by contrast, are used for minor changes to a file which do
        not amount to a new edition.</p>
      <p>No simple rule can specify how substantive changes have to be before they are regarded as
        producing a new edition, rather than a simple update. The general principle proposed here is
        that the production of a new edition entails a significant change in the intellectual
        content of the file, rather than its encoding or appearance. The addition of analytic coding
        to a text would thus constitute a new edition, while automatic conversion from one coded
        representation to another would not. Changes relating to the character code or physical
        storage details, corrections of misspellings, simple changes in the arrangement of the
        contents and changes in the output format do not normally constitute a new edition, whereas
        the addition of new information (e.g., annotations, sound or images, links to external data)
        almost always does.</p>
      <p>Clearly, there will always be borderline cases and the matter is somewhat arbitrary. The
        simplest rule is: if you think that your file is a new edition, then call it such. An
        edition statement is optional for the first release of a computer file; it is mandatory for
        each later release, though this requirement cannot be enforced.</p>
      <p>Note that all changes in a file, whether or not they are regarded as constituting a new
        edition or simply a revision, should be independently noted in the revision description
        section of the file header (see section <ptr target="#revisionDescription"/>).</p>
      <p>The edition element should contain phrases describing the edition or version, including the
        word 'edition', 'version', or an equivalent term, together with a number or date, or terms
        indicating difference from other editions such as 'new edition', 'revised edition', etc. Any
        dates that occur within the edition statement should be marked with the <gi scheme="MEI"
          >date</gi> element. The <att>n</att> attribute of the edition element may be used as
        elsewhere to supply any formal identification (such as a version number) for the
        edition.</p>
      <p>One or more <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi> elements may also be used to supply statements
        of responsibility for the edition in question. These may refer to individuals or corporate
        bodies and can indicate functions such as that of a reviser, or can name the person or body
        responsible for the provision of supplementary matter, of appendices, etc., in a new
        edition.</p>

      <head>Physical Description of the File</head>
      <p>The third component of the fileDesc is a description of the physical qualities of the file.
        The <gi scheme="MEI">extent</gi> element is provided for this purpose.</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="extent"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">extent</gi> element describes the approximate size of a text as stored
        on some carrier medium, whether digital or non-digital, specified in any convenient
        units.</p>
      <p>For printed books, information about the carrier, such as the kind of medium used and its
        size, are of great importance in cataloging procedures. The print-oriented rules for
        bibliographic description of an item's medium and extent need some re-interpretation when
        applied to electronic media. An electronic file exists as a distinct entity quite
        independently of its carrier and remains the same intellectual object whether it is stored
        as file on a hard disc drive, a CD-ROM, a set of USB devices, or in the internet. Since,
        moreover, these Guidelines are specifically aimed at facilitating transparent document
        storage and interchange, any purely machine-dependent information should be irrelevant as
        far as the file header is concerned.</p>
      <p>This is particularly true of information about file-type although library-oriented rules
        for cataloging often distinguish two types of computer file: ‘data’ and ‘programs’. This
        distinction is quite difficult to draw in some cases, for example, hypermedia or texts with
        built-in search and retrieval software.</p>
      <p>Although it is equally system-dependent, some measure of the size of the computer file may
        be of use for cataloging and other practical purposes. Because the measurement and
        expression of file size is fraught with difficulties, only very general recommendations are
        possible; the element <gi scheme="MEI">extent</gi> should contain a phrase indicating the
        size or approximate size of the computer file in one of the following ways:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>in bytes of a specified length (e.g. ‘4000 bytes’)</item>
        <item>as falling within a range of values, for example: <list type="simple">

      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>A group of separate items related to one another by the fact that each item bears, in
          addition to its own title proper, a collective title applying to the group as a whole. The

      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">seriesStmt</gi> element may contain one or more of the following more

      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">editor</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI"

        The <gi scheme="MEI">title</gi> element is required within <gi scheme="MEI"

        issue numbers. Its <att>type</att> attribute is used to categorize the number further,
        taking the value 'ISSN' for an ISSN, for example.</p>

      <p>The contents of the series may be enumerated using the <gi scheme="MEI">contents</gi>
        element. Use of this element should be determined by the complexity of the resource and
        whether or not the information is readily available. The <gi scheme="MEI">contents</gi>
        element may consist of a single paragraph when unstructured information is sufficient.</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">

      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">notesStmt</gi> element is the sixth component of the <gi scheme="MEI"
          >fileDesc</gi> element and is optional. If used, it contains one or more <gi scheme="MEI"
          >annot</gi> elements, each containing a single piece of descriptive information of the

          <specDesc key="notesStmt"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>Some information found in the notes area in conventional bibliography has been assigned
        specific elements in these Guidelines; in particular the following items should be tagged as
        indicated, rather than as general notes:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>the nature, scope, artistic form, or purpose of the work; also the genre or other
          intellectual category to which it may belong. These should be formally described within
          the <gi scheme="MEI">workDesc</gi> element (section <ptr target="#workDescription"
          />).</item>
        <item>bibliographic details relating to the source or sources of an electronic text: e.g.,
          ‘Transcribed from a facsimile of the 1743 publication’. These should be formally described
          in the <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi> element (section <ptr target="#sourceDescription"
          />).</item>
        <item>further information relating to publication, distribution, or release of the text,
          including sources from which the text may be obtained, any restrictions on its use or
          formal terms on its availability. These should be placed in the appropriate division of
          the <gi scheme="MEI">pubStmt</gi> element (section <ptr target="#publicationDistribution"
          />).</item>
        <item>publicly documented numbers associated <emph>with the file</emph> should be placed in
          an <gi scheme="MEI">altId</gi> element within the <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element.
          International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN), International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN),
          and other internationally agreed upon standard numbers that uniquely identify an item,
          should be treated in the same way, rather than as specialized bibliographic notes. As
          described elsewhere, identifiers <emph>for sources of the file</emph> should be recorded
          within the <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi>.</item>
      </list>
      <p>Nevertheless, the <gi scheme="MEI">notesStmt</gi> element may be used to record potentially
        significant details about the file and its features, for example:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>dates, when they are relevant to the content or condition of the computer file: e.g.
          ‘manual dated 2010’, ‘file validated Apr 2011’</item>
        <item>names of persons or bodies connected with the technical production, administration, or
          consulting functions of the effort which produced the file, if these are not named in
          statements of responsibility in the title or edition statements of the file description:
          e.g. ‘Historical commentary provided by members of the Big Symphony Orchestra’</item>
        <item>availability of the file in an additional medium or information not already recorded
          about the availability of documentation: e.g. ‘User manual is loose-leaf in eleven
          paginated sections’</item>
        <item>language of work and abstract, if not encoded in the <gi scheme="MEI">langUsage</gi>
          element, e.g. ‘Text in English with stage directions in French and German’</item>
      </list>
      <p>Each such item of information may be tagged using the general-purpose <gi scheme="MEI"
          >annot</gi> element. Groups of annotations are contained within the <gi scheme="MEI"
          >notesStmt</gi> element, as in the following example:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<notesStmt>
  <annot>Historical commentary provided by John Smith.</annot>
  <annot>OCR scanning performed at University of Virginia.</annot>
</notesStmt>
</egXML>
      <p>There are advantages, however, to encoding such information with more precise elements
        elsewhere in the MEI header, when such elements are available. For example, the notes above
        might be encoded as follows:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">

      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi> element is the seventh and final component of the <gi

        element containing one or more <gi scheme="MEI">source</gi> elements, each of which records
        details of a source from which a computer file is derived. This might be a printed text or
        manuscript, another computer file, an audio or video recording, or a combination of these.
        An electronic file may also have no source, if what is being cataloged is an original text

      <p>In the simplest case, the <gi scheme="MEI">source</gi> element may contain nothing more
        than a notes statement giving a simple prose description or a brief note stating that the

      <p>Alternatively, it may contain a basic bibliographic citation, also in an annotation:</p>

      encoding of the source material. Though not formally required, its use is highly
      recommended.</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="encodingDesc"/>
      </specList>
    </p>
    <p>The encoding description may contain elements taken from the model.encodingPart class. By
      default, this class makes available the following elements:</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="appInfo"/>
        <specDesc key="editorialDecl"/>
        <specDesc key="projectDesc"/>

    <p>Each of these elements is further described in the appropriate section below.</p>
    <div xml:id="applicationInformation" type="div3">
      <head>Application Information</head>
      <p>It is sometimes convenient to store information relating to the processing of an encoded
        resource within its header. Typical uses for such information might be:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>to allow an application to discover that it has previously opened or edited a file,
          and what version of itself was used to do that;</item>
        <item>to show (through a date) which application last edited the file to allow for diagnosis
          of any problems that might have been caused by that application;</item>
        <item>to allow users to discover information about an application used to edit the
          file</item>
        <item>to allow the application to declare an interest in elements of the file which it has
          edited, so that other applications or human editors may be more wary of making changes to
          those sections of the file.</item>
      </list>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="application" atts="version"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>Each <gi scheme="MEI">application</gi> element identifies the current state of one software
        application with regard to the current file. This element is a member of the att.datable
        class, which provides a variety of attributes for associating this state with a date and
        time, or a temporal range. The <att>xml:id</att> and <att>version</att> attributes should be
        used to uniquely identify the application and its major version number (for example, 'Music
        Markup Tool 1.5'). It is not intended that a software application should add a new <gi
          scheme="MEI">application</gi> element each time it touches the file.</p>
      <p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to record the fact that
        version 1.5 of an application called ‘Music Markup Tool’ has an interest in two parts of a
        document. The parts concerned are accessible at the URLs given as targets of the two <gi
          scheme="MEI">ptr</gi> elements. When used on <gi scheme="MEI">application</gi>, the
          <att>date</att> attribute specifies when the application was employed, in this case June
        6, 2011. Version information for the application should be placed in <att>version</att>.</p>

      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">perfMedium</gi> element provides the possibility of describing a work
        in terms of its medium of performance; that is, the performing forces required. In the case
        of a dramatic work, the dramatis personae and associated voice qualities may be enumerated
        using <gi scheme="MEI">castList</gi>. The <gi scheme="MEI">instrumentation</gi> element
        describes the necessary instrumental resources.</p>
      <div xml:id="workCast" type="div4">
        <head>Cast Lists</head>
        <p>A cast list is a specialized form of list, conventionally found at the start or end of a
          dramatic work, usually listing all the speaking/singing and non-speaking/singing roles in
          the play, often with additional description (‘Cataplasma, a maker of Periwigges and
          Attires’) or the name of an actor or actress (‘Old Lady Squeamish. Mrs Rutter’).</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="castList"/>
            <specDesc key="castItem"/>
            <specDesc key="castGrp"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>Cast lists often function as identifying metadata and for this reason are permitted
          within the description of a work.</p>
        <p>Because the format and internal structure of cast lists are unpredictable, a <gi
            scheme="MEI">castList</gi> may contain any combination of <gi scheme="MEI">castItem</gi>
          and <gi scheme="MEI">castGrp</gi> elements.</p>
        <p>A <gi scheme="MEI">castItem</gi> element may contain any mixture of text and the
          following elements:</p>
        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="role"/>
            <specDesc key="roleDesc"/>
            <specDesc key="instrVoice"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <p>In the following example, <gi scheme="MEI">role</gi> provides the name of the dramatic
          character and <gi scheme="MEI">roleDesc</gi> contains a brief description of the role. The
            <gi scheme="MEI">instrVoice</gi> element is used to describe the voice range of the
          role.</p>

        <p>However, this element is unlikely to be useful in the context of a work description. It
          may be used here, however, for the very rare occasion when a work was conceived for and is
          only performable by a single person or group, as for certain "performance art" works.</p>
        <p>It is common to find some roles presented in groups or sublists. Roles are also often
          grouped together by their function. To accommodate these situations, the <gi scheme="MEI"
            >castGrp</gi> element is provided as a component of <gi scheme="MEI">castList</gi>. It
          may contain any combination of <gi scheme="MEI">castItem</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI"

      <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">termList</gi> element categorizes an individual text by supplying a

        schemes, the order of items in the list is significant, for example, from major topic to
        minor; in others, the list has an organized substructure of its own. No recommendations are
        made here as to which method is to be preferred. Wherever possible, such terms should be
        taken from a recognized source.</p>
      <p>The classCode element offers the possibility of capturing a bibliographic citation and/or a

    <p>The final sub-element of the MEI header, the <gi scheme="MEI">revisionDesc</gi> element,
      provides a detailed change log in which each change made to a text may be recorded. Its use is
      optional but highly recommended. It provides essential information for the administration of
      large numbers of files which are being updated, corrected, or otherwise modified as well as
      extremely useful documentation for files being passed from researcher to researcher or system
      to system. Without change logs, it is easy to confuse different versions of a file, or to
      remain unaware of small but important changes made in the file by some earlier link in the
      chain of distribution. No change should be made in any MEI-conformant file without
      corresponding entries being made in the change log.</p>

        <specDesc key="revisionDesc"/>
        <specDesc key="change"/>

    <p>The main purpose of the revision description is to record changes in the text to which a
      header is prefixed. However, it is recommended practice to include entries also for
      significant changes in the header itself (other than the revision description itself, of
      course). At the very least, an entry should be supplied indicating the date of creation of the
      header.</p>
    <p>The log consists of a list of <gi scheme="MEI">change</gi> elements, each of which contains a
      detailed description of the changes made. If a number is to be associated with one or more
      changes (for example, a revision number), the <att>n</att> attribute may be used to indicate
      it. The person responsible for the change and the date of the change may be indicated by the
        <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">date</gi> elements. The description of
      the change itself is contained within the <gi scheme="MEI">changeDesc</gi> element, which can
      hold one or more paragraphs.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to give changes in reverse chronological order, most recent first.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">

    </changeDesc>
    <date isodate="2011-10-21"/>
  </change>
</revisionDesc>
</egXML>
    <p>A slightly shorter form for recording changes is also available when a the date of the change
      can be described by a single date in a standard ISO form and when the name of the agent(s)
      responsible for the change, encoded elsewhere in the header, can be referred to by one or more
      URIs given in the <att>resp</att> attribute. For example:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">

    <head>Minimal and Recommended Header Information</head>
    <p>The MEI header allows for the provision of a very large amount of information concerning the
      text itself, its source, its encodings, and revisions of it, as well as a wealth of
      descriptive information, such as the languages it uses and the situation(s) in which it was
      produced, together with the setting and identity of participants within it. This diversity and
      richness reflects the diversity of uses to which it is envisaged that electronic texts
      conforming to these Guidelines will be put. It is emphatically not intended that all of the
      elements described above should be present in every MEI Header.</p>
    <p>The amount of encoding in a header will depend both on the nature and the intended use of the
      text. At one extreme, an encoder may expect that the header will be needed only to provide a
      bibliographic identification of the text adequate to local needs. At the other, wishing to
      ensure that their texts can be used for the widest range of applications, encoders will want
      to document as explicitly as possible both bibliographic and descriptive information, in such
      a way that no prior or ancillary knowledge about the text is needed in order to process it.
      The header in such a case will be very full, approximating the kind of documentation often
      supplied in the form of a manual. Most texts will lie somewhere between these extremes;
      textual corpora in particular will tend more to the latter extreme. In the remainder of this
      section we demonstrate first the minimal, and then a commonly recommended, level of encoding
      for the bibliographic information held by the MEI header.</p>
    <p>Supplying only the level of encoding required, the MEI header of a single text will look like
      the following example:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<meiHead>
  <fileDesc>
    <titleStmt>
      <title>Fughette (in Gottes Namen Fahren wir - Dies sind die heil'gen zehn Gebote) for
        Brass Quintett : an electronic transcription</title>

      </respStmt>
    </pubStmt>
  </fileDesc>
</meiHead>
</egXML>
    <p>The only mandatory component of the MEI Header is the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element.
      Within this element, <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">pubStmt</gi> are
      required constituents. Within the title statement, a title is required. Within the <gi
        scheme="MEI">pubStmt</gi>, a publisher, distributor, or other agency responsible for the
      file is required.</p>
    <p>While not formally required, additional information is recommended for a minimally effective
      header. For example, it is recommended that the person or corporate entity responsible for the
      creation of the encoding should be specified using <gi scheme="MEI">respStmt</gi> within the
        <gi scheme="MEI">titleStmt</gi> element. It is also recommended that information about the
      source, or sources, of the encoding be included. Each <gi scheme="MEI">source</gi> element
      should contain at the least a loosely structured bibliographic citation that identifies the
      source used to construct the MEI file.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, If the electronic transcription is a member of a series of publications, the
      series title and publisher should be included using the <gi scheme="MEI">seriesStmt</gi>
      element. It is also common for cataloging records to include genre and/or form information,
      here represented by the MEI <gi scheme="MEI">classification</gi> element.</p>
    <p>We now present the same example header, expanded to include additionally recommended
      information, adequate for most bibliographic purposes, in particular to allow for the creation
      of an AACR2-conformant bibliographic record.</p>

    <head>Independent Headers</head>
    <p>Many libraries, repositories, research sites and related institutions collect bibliographic
      and documentary information about machine readable music documents without necessarily
      collecting the music documents themselves. Such institutions may thus want access to the
      header of an MEI document without its attached text in order to build catalogs, indexes and
      databases that can be used to locate relevant texts at remote locations, obtain full
      documentation about those texts, and learn how to obtain them. This section describes a set of
      practices by which the metadata headers of MEI documents can be encoded separately from those
      documents and exchanged as freestanding MEI documents. Headers exchanged independently of the
      documents they describe are called independent headers.</p>
    <div xml:id="independentHeaderDefinition" type="div3">
      <head>Definition and Principles for Encoders</head>
      <p>An independent header is an MEI metadata header that can be exchanged as an independent
        document between libraries, archives, collections, projects, and individuals.</p>
      <p>The structure of an independent header is exactly the same as that of an header attached to
        a document. This means that an <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> can be extracted from an MEI
        document and sent to a receiving institution with little or no change.
        <!--However, some fields that are
        listed as ‘optional’ in the header are listed as ‘recommended’ for the independent header.
        For this reason, this section should be consulted in connection with any plan to provide
        headers as independent documents.--></p>
      <p>When deciding which information to include in the independent header, and the format or
        structure of that information, the following should be kept in mind:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>The independent header should provide full bibliographic information about the encoded
          text, its sources, where the text can be located, and any restrictions governing its
          use.</item>
        <item>The independent header should contain useful information about the encoding of the
          text itself. In this regard, it is highly recommended that the encoding description be as
          complete as possible. The Guidelines do not require that the encoding description be
          included in the header (since some simple transcriptions of small items may not require
          it), but in practice the use of a header without an encoding description would be severely
          limited.</item>
        <item>The independent header should be amenable to automatic processing, particularly for
          loading into databases and for the creation of publications, indexes, and finding aids,
          without undue editorial intervention on the part of the receiving institution. For this
          reason, two recommendations are made regarding the format or structure of the header:
          first, where there is a choice between a prose content model and one that contains a
          formal series of specialized elements, wherever possible and appropriate the specialized
          elements should be preferred to unstructured prose. Second, with respect to corpora,
          information about each of the texts within a corpus should be included in the overall
          corpus-level <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi>. That is, source information, editorial
          practices, encoding descriptions, and the like should be included in the relevant sections
          of the corpus <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi>, with pointers to them from the headers of the
          individual texts included in the corpus. There are three reasons for this recommendation:
          first, the corpus-level header will contain the full array of bibliographic and
          documentary information for each of the texts in a corpus, and thus be of great benefit to
          remote users, who may have access only to the independent header; second, such a layout is
          easier for the coder to maintain than searching for information throughout a text; and
          third, generally speaking, this practice results in greater overall consistency,
          especially with respect to bibliographic citations.</item>

      <head>Header Elements and their Relationship to Other Bibliographic Standards</head>
      <p>Mapping elements from the MEI metadata header to another descriptive system may help a
        repository harvest selected data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record. For this
        purpose, the following attribute is provided on most meiHead elements:</p>
      <p>
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="att.bibl" atts="analog"/>
        </specList>
      </p>
      <p>The encoding system to which fields are mapped must be specified in <att>analog</att>. When
        possible, subfields as well as fields should be specified, e.g., subfields within MARC
        fields.</p>

  <div xml:id="relatedItemVsFRBR" type="div2">

    <head>RelatedItem vs. FRBR</head>
    <p> MEI offers two related concepts for capturing relations between bibliographic items. The
      model of <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>, as described in chapter <ptr
        target="#relatedItemDesc"/> of these Guidelines, is derived from MODS v3.4 (see
      documentation <ref
        target="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-userguide-elements.html#relateditem"
        >here</ref>). Its purpose in MEI is to encode bibliographic references between mostly
      "secondary" material, like reviews, articles, and so on. It may be used to provide
      cross-references between information encoded in different places of the header. </p>
    <!-- TODO: Provide example here… -->
    <p> However, <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> is less ideal for describing the relations
      between works, differing versions of these works, the sources in which those versions are
      transmitted, and where applicable the individual copies of a print. For these situations, it
      is strongly recommended to use the <ref target="#FRBR">FRBR module</ref> instead. This module
      is based on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, as <ref
        target="http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records"
        >specified</ref> by the <ref target="http://www.ifla.org">IFLA</ref>. It allows a much finer
      description of relationships between such "primary" entities. For compatibility reasons, both
      models should not be confused or mixed under any circumstances. </p>
